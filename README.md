## ðŸ›  Data Quality Issues
The report contains several **data inconsistencies and formatting problems** that make analysis challenging:

- **Inconsistent units:** Mixing of "K" (thousands), "M" (millions), and raw numbers without clear standardization.
- **Duplicate sections:** Multiple "Sales Quantity by Market" tables with conflicting data.
- **Missing data:** No data for **2019**, and some tables have incomplete or unclear headers.
- **Formatting errors:** Apparent **copy-paste issues** in the "Total Amount" rows with repeating values.

## ðŸ“ˆ Observable Trends

### ðŸ”¹ Revenue Growth

### ðŸ”¹ Customer Analysis
